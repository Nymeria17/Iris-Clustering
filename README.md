#Iris Dataset Clustering Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering on the famous Iris dataset. The goal is to group iris flowers into clusters based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project includes data loading, preprocessing, K-Means clustering, and visualization of the results.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file.
- **Preprocessing**: Selects relevant features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) for clustering.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Applies the K-Means algorithm to group the data into clusters.
- **Visualization**: Plots the clusters using a scatter plot to visualize the groupings.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-clustering.git
   cd iris-clustering
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris-cluster.ipynb
   ```

3. **Follow the notebook**:
   - The notebook is divided into sections for loading data, preprocessing, applying K-Means clustering, and visualizing the results.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The features included are:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Results
The K-Means algorithm groups the iris flowers into clusters based on their sepal and petal measurements. The scatter plot visualizes these clusters, showing how the flowers are grouped.
